* This is the first release.
* I have developed the package along a university course and some empirical studies, so it has been used and discussed by students and academic researchers. We already used the package to generate reports for empirical survey studies. That's why there are already deprecations in the first release.
* The package is developend on Windows and in a RStudio Server environment (Linux). We tested it on Mac as well.
* I aim at battle testing the package in a 200 persons statistics course which starts in April 2024, preparations are already running. That's why I want to publish to CRAN if possible (?) within the next week. I guess you will tell me if it's too unrealistic.
* Several features are drafted, you'll find some unused code and todo comments, for example preparing topic modeling
