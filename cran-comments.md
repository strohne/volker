## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* As requested: Fixed invalid file URIs by removing links from README.md 
* In addition: Proof read docstrings a second time and fixed some typos
* In addition: Revised plot height calculation
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is the first release.
* Because of the package type, tests and vignettes include rendered plots, that makes the package large
* Several features are drafted for next versions, you'll find some unused code and todo comments, for example preparing topic modeling
