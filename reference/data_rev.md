# Reverse item values

Reverse item values

## Usage

``` r
data_rev(data, cols)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing the items to be reversed.

- cols:

  A tidy selection of columns to reverse. For example, if you want to
  calculate an index of the two items "I feel bad about this" and "I
  like it", both coded with 1=not at all to 5=fully agree, you need to
  reverse one of them to make the codings compatible.

## Value

A data frame with the specified items reversed.
