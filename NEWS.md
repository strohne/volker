# volker 3.2.0

* Implemented linear modeling in `add_model()`
  including effect sizes, standardised betas and  adjusted p values
* Implemented reliability calculation and classification performance indicators
  in `agree_tab()`
* Implemented cooccurrence analysis: `report_counts()` generates 
  heatmaps (tiles-parameter) and npmi values (method-parameter).
* Option to keep missings if possible by setting `options(vlkr.na.omit=FALSE)`
  (pairwise instead of listwise handling of missings)

  provide a first draft of lm analysis
